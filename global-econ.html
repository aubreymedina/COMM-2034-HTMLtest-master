    <br><h1>Class Overview</h1>
    <p>This  course is  designed  to introduce  students  to  the  broad  contours  of  the  past  and  present debates surrounding globalization. In analyzing these debates, students will become familiar with key themes and theories ininternational relations(IR)and international political economy(IPE). The  required  readings  will  introduce  students  to a  variety  of  different  economic  schools  of thought,including  classical  and  neoclassical  approaches,  as  well  as  more  critical  branchesof scholarship.  These  economic  schools  of  thought  will  be  analyzed  in  tandem  with  an  in-depth examination  of  the  main  theoretical  perspectives  in  present-day  IPE  scholarship.  By  analyzing the   work   of   prominent   authors   who   hail   from   neomercantilist,   liberal,   constructivist, Marxist/neo-Marxist,  and  feminist  schools  of  thought,  this  class  will  shed  light  on  the  complex web  of public  and  privaterelationships  that  current  discussions  of  globalization  are  centered upon. <p/>

<br><h1>My Take</h1>
      <p>This class is extremely difficult for me. Although I have a pretty solid background in International Studies, right off the bat, Dr. Cutter expected us to know several topics. This was concerning, as the course was thought to be an introductory class to economy and politics. The readings assigned are rather lengthy (30 pages a night) and very dense. There are 4 quizzes throughout the semester, each have less than 10 questions. Although she tells you beforehand which readings the questions will come from, they are still hard because, like I said, the readings are very long and the questions are pretty specific. She's a very kind professor, but if you don't have the time to read chapters a night, I don't reccomend this class.</p>
