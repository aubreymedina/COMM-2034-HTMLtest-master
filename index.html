      <br><p>Hi! My name is Aubrey Medina and I am a junior at Virginia Tech, double majoring in International Studies and Multimedia Journalism. </p>
      <br><p> I have always been interested in different cultures and traveling, so coming to college and majoring in International Studies was a given for me. Specializing in Global Development stems from my passion in service and helping others.<p/>
      <br><p>At the end of my sophomore year, I realized that my hobby of production, performing and storytelling could be more than just a hobby; thus, I added Multimedia Journalism in hopes of one day intermeshing my interest of international studies with storytelling.</p>
      <br><p>Currently I am Vice President of the Filipino American Student Association, Virginia Tech's Filipino cultural and social organization that hopes to provide students of all ethnicities a home away from home. I am also the Social Media Intern for Women's Enabled International, a nongovernmental organization that hopes to advance human rights for women and girls with disabilities. This semester I also began working for the YMCA at Virginia Tech as their Public Relations and Communications employee.</p>
      <br><p>One day I hope to work for a humanitarian organization and document global health service projects through video.</p>
      <br><p>I hope you find this page useful in learning the classes I'm taking as an International Studies and Multimedia Journalism major, and as a student at Virginia Tech! For each class, I have included the course's general overview and materials, as well as my personal take on the course.</p>
