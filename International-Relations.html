<br><h1>My Take</h1>
<p>I enjoy this class because I hope to work for an organization similar to the ones we study in class. The structure of the class is pretty easy to follow: lecture, and then exam on the lecture. It is clear which lectures will be on the exams; thus, it is rather easy to study for them. The PowerPoints are posted on Canvas, but it is more beneficial to go to class because the slides do not include all the important details that may be on the exams. The exams are straightforward: there are 10 essay questions, but you are to pick two to answer. The lectures are easier to follow and more intriguing when Professor Donahue teaches them; he's very straightforward and clear, whereas Dr. Stivachtis has a thick Greek accent and often rambles, making it somewhat hard to understand him. Overall, I enjoy this class! If only I was a morning person and could make it all the time (it's at 9:30 a.m.)</p>
