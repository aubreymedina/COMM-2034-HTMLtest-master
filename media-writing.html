    <br><h1>Class Overview</h1>
    <p>This course will address the fundamental building blocks of writing and editing in various types of media. In addition to writing with accuracy, students will strive to hone their skills in gathering and organizing information while working under deadline pressure. Detail is extremely crucial in this course. Throughout the semester, student writing will reflect correct usage of the English language that includes spelling, grammar, style consistency and accuracy as well as compliance with the rules in The Associated Press Stylebook. This course requires completion of COMM 1014.<p/>
     <br><p>Specifically, you will learn how to do the following:
      <li>write a publishable news story</li>
      <li>write a basic feature story</li>
      <li>conduct a journalistic interview</li>
      <li>understand some of the ethical decisions and responsibilities of media writing</li>

<br><h1>My Take</h1>
<p>At first, I was really scared of this class. I read a lot of reviews for Dr. Jenkins, and everyone said he is the hardest grader when it comes to all the Media Writing professors at Virginia Tech. First meeting him, he made it very clear to our class that we will become much better writers after his class, and I can attest to that! My first piece submitted, the interview, scored a whopping 59%. My latest piece, the Event Story, scored a 93%! Because we take our AP Style quizzes so often, I find myself correcting my own grammar, as well as my friends' (annoyingly). I am much more confident in my writing, as well as my overall skills as a journalist, because of this class. Although I am not sure if I exactly want to be a writer post-graduation, I know that with a Communication degree its rather necessary to have those skills, and I'm more confident accepting writing-based positions. I also look forward to this class because we discuss current events for about 30 minutes. Dr. Jenkins says its important to be updated on what's going on in the world as potentional journalists, and it gives me more conversation starters outside of the classroom. I can tell Dr. Jenkins really cares about his students and where they go; he tells us stories about where his past students have ended up and where their entires have been published. I definitely reccommend this class if you don't mind your grade being a bit low at the end of the semester, but you really value learning useful, applicable skills. </p>
