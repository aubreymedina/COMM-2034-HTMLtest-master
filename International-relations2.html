    <br><h1>Class Overview</h1>
    <p>This course introduces students to key theoretical approaches, concepts, and themes of international relations.  As a field, international relations is fundamentally concerned with systematically accounting for the nature of power, authority, interdependence, difference, and justice at the level of the “international.”  In order to understand these dimensions of international life, however, we must first interrogate how we come to know about the world.  Through what lenses do we come to see, and identify, the space and time of world politics, its principal agents and structures, and forms of action? This course emphasizes that our ways of knowing about the international are inherently political in so much as they foreground particular actors, processes, and structures while foreclosing others.  In so doing, international relations theory materializes the very world it seeks to explain and understand.  The course will familiarize students with the major approaches to international relations theory, and will, in particular, focus upon the political implications of the lenses we choose to adopt when studying the international.  <p/>

<br><h1>My Take</h1>
<p>I hate this class. The course is very ideological, something I am not really good at. Sometimes Dr. Gill doesn't have slides to go along with his lecture, so it's hard to follow along what exactly we're talking about. The structure of the course is as follows: Attempt to read the long, dense, boring readings; come to class and attempt to discuss the long, boring, readings; randomly submit two papers throughout the year (one is a prompted essay, the other is an Annotated Bibliography); take a final exam. This class is very difficult and I reccommend taking it with another professor if possible. No offense to Dr. Gill! He's an interesting person and once in a while inserts a personal story from his life in Canada to go along with the subject, but that's only if you're lucky. Apparently he's also a poet - haven't been able to find his work online though.</p>
